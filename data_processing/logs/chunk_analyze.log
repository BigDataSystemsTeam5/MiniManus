2025-03-30 13:12:31,382 - INFO - All  our  notes are unsecured senior obligations. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the notes. Our notes  pay  interest  semi-annually.  We  may  redeem  each  of  our  notes  prior  to  maturity,  subject  to  a  make-whole  premium  as  defined  in  the applicable form of note.

As of April 30, 2023, we were in compliance with the required covenants, which are non-financial in nature, under the outstanding notes.

## Commercial Paper

We  have  a  $575  million  commercial  paper  program  to  support  general  corporate  purposes.  As  of  April  30,  2023,  we  had  not  issued  any commercial paper.

## Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies

## Purchase Obligations

Our purchase obligations reflect our commitments to purchase components used to manufacture our products, including long-term supply and capacity agreements, certain software and technology licenses, other goods and services and long-lived assets.

As of April 30, 2023, we had outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations totaling $7.27 billion. During the normal course of business, to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us, and in certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, but these changes may result in the payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation.

Other non-inventory purchase obligations of $3.26 billion include $2.43 billion of multi-year cloud service agreements.
2025-03-30 13:12:31,391 - INFO - penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.

We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist, such as our Omniverse platform, thirdparty large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases and applications. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.

Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times  may  occur  if  we  experience  other  supply  constraints  caused  by  natural  disasters,  pandemics  or  other  events.  In  addition,  geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.

2025-03-30 13:42:22,892 - INFO - Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls  to  restrict  additional  gaming  products,  it  may  disrupt  a  significant  portion  of  our  supply  and  distribution  chain  and  negatively  impact  sales  of  such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as highspeed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside  the  scope  of  such  control
2025-03-30 13:42:22,898 - INFO - Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.

## Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We  enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  movements  on  our  operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of May 1, 2022 and January 30, 2022.

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

## NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2025-03-30 13:49:29,572 - INFO - We have approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of May 1, 2022 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. We utilized almost all of our accumulated U.S. federal research tax credits during fiscal year 2022, resulting in higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2023, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. This will impact cash flows from operations and will result in significantly higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023.

## Capital Return to Shareholders

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we returned $2.00 billion in share repurchases and $100 million in cash dividends. On May 23, 2022, our Board of Directors increased and extended our share repurchase program to repurchase additional common stock up to a total of $15 billion through December 2023.

Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to the continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends are in the best interests of our shareholders.

2025-03-30 14:04:15,736 - INFO - As of October 30, 2022, we had $13.14 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $8.07 billion from the end of fiscal year 2022. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.

Cash provided by operating activities decreased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, primarily due to tax payments, and a decrease in net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as the Arm acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion, partially offset by changes in working capital.

Cash provided by investing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to cash used in the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by higher marketable securities sales and maturities, lower purchases of marketable securities, offset by higher capital expenditures.

Cash used in financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, which primarily reflects share repurchases and the absence of debt issuance proceeds in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023.

## Note 8 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis.
2025-03-30 14:58:43,662 - INFO - ## Demand

Demand for  our  products  is  based  on  many  factors,  including  our  product  introductions  and  transitions,  competitor announcements,  and  competing  technologies,  all  of  which  can  impact  the  timing  and  amount  of  our  revenue.  For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated  in  the  past  and  is  likely  to  continue  to  change  quickly.  Volatility  in  the  cryptocurrency  market,  including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we believe Gaming benefited from cryptocurrency mining demand, although it is  hard  to  determine  to  what  extent.  Additionally,  consumer  behavior  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  such  as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and notebook workstation products, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.

## Gross Margin

Our overall gross margin increased to 64.8% and 64.5% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2022, respectively, from 58.8% and 61.6% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2021, respectively. These increases are primarily due to the absence of a non-recurring inventory step-up expense of $161 million related to the Mellanox acquisition and higher ASPs within desktop GeForce GPUs with continued growth in highend Ampere architecture products, partially offset by a mix shift within the Compute &amp; Networking segment.

Inventory provisions totaled $73 million and $45 million for the second quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or -down totaled $20 million and $49 million for the second quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.8% and insignificant in the second quarter of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Inventory provisions totaled $131 million and $81 million for the first half of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or -down totaled $41 million and $88 million for the first half of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.7% and insignificant in the first half of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

## Investment and Interest Rate Risk

We are  exposed  to  interest  rate  risk  related  to  our  fixed-rate  investment  portfolio  and  outstanding  debt.  The  investment  portfolio  is  managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.

As of January 30, 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a zero percent yield floor, would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $33 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $22 million, respectively.

At  January  30,  2022,  we  had  $11.00  billion  of  senior  Notes  outstanding.  We  carry  the  Notes  at  face  value  less  unamortized  discount  on  our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.

## NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Unaudited)

For  the  first  half  of  fiscal  year  2021,  there  have  been  no  material  changes  to  our  tax  years  that  remain  subject  to  examination  by  major  tax jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we assumed $59 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $4 million of related interest through the Mellanox acquisition. Other than these amounts, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of July 26, 2020, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

## Note 7 - Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as 'available-for-sale' debt securities.

The following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of July 26, 2020 and January 26, 2020:

2025-03-30 17:05:55,526 - INFO - Goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination. We recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability.  Intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of  technology,  customer  relationships,  order  backlog and trade name acquired in a business combination and IPR&amp;D. We generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques. To estimate fair value, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Our estimates require significant judgment and are based on historical data, various internal  estimates,  and  external  sources.  Our  assessment  of  IPR&amp;D  also  includes  consideration  of  the  risk  of  the  projects  not  achieving technological feasibility.

There have been no other material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020. Refer to Note 1 'Basis of Presentation' to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details. In addition, please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.

On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

## Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.

In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes.
2025-03-30 17:23:50,012 - INFO - We allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values.

The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected  to  be  deductible  for  foreign  tax  purposes.  Goodwill  arising  from  the  Mellanox  acquisition  has  been  allocated  to  the  Compute  and Networking segment. Refer to Note 17 - Segment Information for further details on segments.

The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable  to  Mellanox  was  approximately  10%  for  fiscal  year  2021.  There  is  not  a  practical  way  to  determine  net  income attributable  to  Mellanox  due  to  integration.  Acquisition-related  costs  attributable  to  Mellanox  of  $28  million  were  included  in  selling,  general  and administrative expense for fiscal year 2021.

2025-03-30 17:49:45,477 - INFO - ## Note 6 - Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax expense of $54 million and $48 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020 , respectively, and $79 million  and  $146 million  for the  second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020 was 8.8% and 4.9% , respectively, and 6.7% and 5.9% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 , respectively.

The increase in our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax, and a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in the impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal year 2020 as compared to the first half of fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit and stock-based compensation.

Our effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were 4.9% and 5.9% , respectively, and were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit.

2025-03-30 18:01:14,739 - INFO - On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise  value  of  approximately  $6.9  billion  as  of  the  date  of  the  Merger  Agreement.  In  June  2019,  Mellanox  shareholders  approved  the acquisition. The closing of the acquisition is subject to approval by

regulatory  agencies.  If  the  Merger  Agreement  is  terminated  under  certain  circumstances  involving  the  failure  to  obtain  the  required  regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million. We have received regulatory approval in the United States and Mexico and are engaged with regulators in Europe and China. Although discussions with the European Union and China regulatory bodies are progressing and closing the acquisition  is  possible  by  the  end  of  this  calendar  year,  we  believe  the  closing  will  likely  occur  in  the  early  part  of calendar 2020.
