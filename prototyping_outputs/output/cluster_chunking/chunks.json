Further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in Israel . Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations . We did not experience any significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.",

The amendments in the standard are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.
